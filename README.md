# Hilla SSO Kit

SSO Kit is an add-on for Hilla that provides all the configuration you need to add single sign-on capabilities to your applications.

SSO Kit is built upon the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) specification and it comes with a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) starter module that takes care of configuring the security settings you need to authenticate against your identity provider.

These are the currently supported identity providers:

- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)
- [Okta](https://okta.com/)
- [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/)

SSO Kit is compatible with [Hilla](https://hilla.dev/) starting from version [2.0.0](https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/releases/tag/2.0.0).

### More details and the [Getting Started](https://hilla.dev/docs/lit/tools/sso-kit/getting-started) can be found in the [Hilla documentation](https://hilla.dev/docs).
